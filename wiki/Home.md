### **Features**

#### **Intro Song Management**

- **URL Support**: Provide a YouTube URL or another music link.
- **File Upload**: Upload a music file directly into the Discord chat.
- **Volume Control**: Optionally set a volume between 0 and 100 when configuring your intro.

#### **EventWaiter Pattern**

The bot leverages an EventWaiter pattern to manage user inputs and responses seamlessly. This ensures that responses are timed correctly and users are properly prompted when necessary.

For example, when setting an intro song, the bot will wait for the user's response (URL or file upload) and store the information accordingly.

#### **Custom Logging**

The bot includes a logging system that adds contextual information (like Guild or User) for each log line. This helps during debugging, giving insight into where and when each event occurs.

Logging is managed through `DiscordLogger`, injecting useful details such as:
- **Guild name and ID**
- **User who triggered the event**

### **Technical Details**

---

#### **Bot Architecture**
- **Kotlin-based**: The bot is built using Kotlin with the JDA library to interact with the Discord API.
- **Spring Boot Integration**: This bot uses Spring Boot for dependency injection and bean management.
- **PostgreSQL**: All user data, including `MusicDto`, is persisted in a PostgreSQL database.

#### **Database**

The bot stores user intro songs using a `MusicDto` table, where each row represents a user's intro song, associated with the user and guild. Ensure you have PostgreSQL running before starting the bot.

- `id`: Primary key
- `userId`: Discord User ID
- `guildId`: Discord Guild ID
- `fileName`: The file name of the uploaded file or the URL string
- `volume`: Volume level of the intro

#### **Testing**

Unit testing is done using `MockK` for mocking interactions. You can run tests using the following:

```bash
./gradlew test
```
